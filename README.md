- [x] Write Numbers from 0-9 on the display using a Keypad
  -> and save them in a kind of fast memory	
  
- [x] Clear the display & memory using the 'C' key

- [x] If you make a mistake you can delete your entry with the 'D' key

### What do we want to be able to do?! (>.<)
- [ ] Using an RTC to track the Time

- [ ] U should pick your own time when u want to get your medicals _up to 4 times a day_
