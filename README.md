# MedDisp
MedDisp is to become a medication dispenser which dispenses medication at specified times.
MedDisp is a practical project as part of the MINT orientation course at TUM.

# Goal of the project
To build a medical dispenser using the Arduino-Uno as control system.

The MedDisp aims to assist people who have trouble taking their medication regularly, especially those affected by conditions like dementia.
Its main goal is to provide support for individuals who need to take medicine consistently but face difficulties in managing it effectively.

With its easy-to-use interface and thoughtful design, the MedDisp simplifies the medication routine for its users.
It helps alleviate the challenges and uncertainties that can arise from memory impairments and other related obstacles.

This promotes their overall well-being and improves their quality of life. 
It specifically addresses the unique needs of those dealing with dementia and similar conditions, making it an invaluable tool in their healthcare journey.
In summary, the MedDisp is a solution that tackles the challenges of medication management.
It provides a reliable and user-friendly approach, bringing ease, confidence, and peace of mind to individuals who struggle with regular medication intake.
Its aim is to help people lead healthier and more fulfilling lives.

### What do we want to be able to do?! (>.<)
- [x] start sequence (greeting/program start after pressing the joystick)
- [x] introduce an interactive menu
- [ ] Using an RTC to track the Time
- [ ] U should pick your own time when u want to get your medicals _up to 4 times a day_
- [ ] And of course the Hardware will look amazing [â€¢.-]
